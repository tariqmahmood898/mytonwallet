     * - 'pending' — awaiting confirmation from an external/unauthenticated source.
     *
     * There are two backends: ToncenterApi and our backend.
     * Swaps returned by ToncenterApi have the status 'pending'.
     * Swaps returned by our backend also have the status 'pending', but they are meant to be 'pendingTrusted'.
     * When an activity reaches the `GlobalState`, it already has the correct status set.
     *
     * TODO: Replace the status 'pending' with 'pendingTrusted' on our backend once all clients are updated.
